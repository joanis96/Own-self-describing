        <p>Hi there, I am Jean P. I start coding since a few months and all I want is to become better to make a difference into this world. To make big changes to this reality. I am ready to get better than ever man ! No kidding !!!</p>
        
        <h2>Steps to success !!!</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing I should do is to become a <strong>frontend developer</strong>.
            Next is to have <strong>backend</strong> experience too. Then I will be able to experience <strong>fullstack</strong> !</li><br>
            
            <li>Of Course I have to work on <strong>developing apps</strong> too. As I did before when I learned how to make games app on Unity. I will be able to do it from scratch someday. As I did with Kotlin but it was tutorial !! I have to build <em>Real World Projects</em> !!</li><br>
            
            <li>I will become a <strong>web developer</strong> to master the client-server relation and coding fondamentals. Javascript is a masterpiece to learn at this time. For frontend JS will be key for the rest. For backend I will use PHP at start. Database with MySQL.</li><br>
            
            <li>When I finaly get some solid skills on fondamentals then I will be looking for <strong>frameworks</strong> because it makes some of the job get done quicker wich will let me focus on the  real deal !! Solving issue throught algoritms and data structure.</li><br>
            
            <li>When I get very good to this I should get my hands on <strong>mobile apps development</strong> too. Because I know everything is linked in life. So getting strong in web development will get me strong in mobile development too. Of course I aint talking about mastering everything but about knowing everything then I will get my own way on master a few. It is humanly <strong>impossible to master everything</strong> because everything change so fast nowadays</li><br>
            
            <li>Then I should be ready to be a <strong>fullStack</strong> developer!!</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>As I always liked computers, of course I got some skills on research, solving issues etc. etc.</p>
